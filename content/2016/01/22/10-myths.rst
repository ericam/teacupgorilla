Buntport Collaboration: 10 Myths...
===================================

We're excited to be working with `Buntport Theater`_
on a stage adaptation/supplement to `Miriam`_'s novel,
`Riding SideSaddle*`_.
The novel is an open-source text
published on 250 interchangeable note cards,
and also `released online`_ with music by Teacup Gorilla.
Now we're working with Buntport to add new material,
and put it all on stage,
in a production called
`10 Myths on the Proper Application of Beauty Products`_.

The story follows a cast of friends as they navigate fluid genders,
relationships, and bodies that resist order, category, or completion —
written by a trans woman, and narrated from a transgender perspective.
The dark comed is set in one shared bathroom
(with a band in the bathtub),
as the characters struggle with love,
death, casserole, and the proper way to pluck their eyebrows.
