Adjectives
==========

**Teacup Gorilla** are a petite & deadly ground-dwelling band
that inhabits the china shops of Denver, CO
with angular riffs,
twisted stories,
and obtuse stomping.


.. BAND / BUSINESS
.. ---------------

`Daniel`_, `Eric`_, and `Sondra`_ have been
playing/fighting together over fifteen years,
across a wide range of projects, genres, and media.
They have performed at book releases and bars,
poetry readings, and hard-core house shows —
composed live theatre soundtracks,
and founded the `The Bakery`_ arts warehouse.
Teacup Gorilla's debut EP, `The Holes They Leave`_
was released in 2015 at the `Hi Dive`_ in Denver.

.. MUSIC
.. -----

With a dark indie sound,
post-rock tendencies,
and a strong literary bent — 
Teacup Gorilla is often compared to
`Velvet Underground`_, early `Modest Mouse`_, and `Low`_.
