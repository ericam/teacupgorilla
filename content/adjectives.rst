Adjectives
==========

**Teacup Gorilla** are a petite & deadly ground-dwelling band
that inhabits the china shops of Denver, CO
with angular riffs,
twisted stories,
and obtuse stomping.

.. BAND / BUSINESS
.. ---------------

`Daniel`_, `Eric`_, and `Sondra`_ have been
playing/fighting together over ten years,
across a wide range of genres & media.
They have performed at book releases and bars,
poetry readings, and hard-core house shows —
composed live theatre soundtracks,
founded the `The Bakery`_ arts warehouse,
and infiltrated great local venues
like `Larimer Lounge`_, `Pikes Peak Brewing Co`_,
and `Syntax Physic Opera`_.


.. MUSIC
.. -----

With a dark indie sound,
post-rock tendencies,
and a strong literary bent — 
Teacup Gorilla has been
compared to `Somerset Catalog`_,
`Velvet Underground`_, `Rabit is a Sphere`_,
`The Pixies`_, and `Pavement`_.
They are also inspired by the diverse sounds of
`Tom Waits`_, `The Breeders`_, `The Widow’s Bane`_,
`Modest Mouse`_, `Mogwai`_, `Bad Luck City`_,
`Songs: Ohia`_, `Godspeed You! Black Emperor`_,
`Fugazi`_, and `Low`_ (to name an odd few).

They may be fine artists in the parlor,
but they're nasty in the garage.
