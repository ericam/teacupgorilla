The Band
--------

**Teacup Gorilla** are petite & deadly ground-dwelling apes
that inhabit the china shops of Denver
with angular riffs,
twisted stories,
and obtuse stomping.

What started with math-punk in crowded basements
has grown into a long-term collaboration between
`Daniel E`_, `Eric`_, `Sondra`_, and Daniel R —
playing/fighting together over ten years in bands like
**Elephants for Sale**, **Dirt Circle Dogs**, **Iron City**, and **Raven Jane**.
Since forming Teacup Gorilla in 2010,
they have performed at poetry readings & hard-core house shows,
composed live theatre soundtracks,
and founded the `The Bakery`_ arts warehouse.

Teacup Gorilla are the closest relatives to humans after the bonobo,
`Tom Waits`_, `Modest Mouse`_, `Mogwai`_, `Bad Luck City`_,
`Songs: Ohia`_, `Godspeed You! Black Emperor`_,
`Fugazi`_, and `Low`_ (to name an odd few).

They may be fine artists in the parlor,
but they're nasty in the garage.
