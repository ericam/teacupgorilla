**Teacup Gorilla** inhabits the venues of Denver, CO
with dark indie-rock soundscapes and evocative poetry â€”
often compared to early `Modest Mouse`_,
`Low`_, or the Velvet Underground.
In the summer of 2015 they
released a debut EP
(`The Holes They Leave`_)
along with the multimedia novel
`Riding SideSaddle*`_.

Teacup Gorilla enjoys collaborating across media
with performers, writers, dancers,
and even the `Clyfford Still Museum`_,
Their 2016 `Buntport Theater`_ collaboration --
10 Myths on the Proper Application of Beauty Products --
was honored with a `True West Award`_.
In 2018,
they worked with `Grapefruit Lab`_
to create `JANE/EYRE`_:
half-concert half theater adaptation.
