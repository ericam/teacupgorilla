**Teacup Gorilla** inhabits the venues of Denver, CO
with dark indie-rock soundscapes and evocative poetry —
often compared to early `Modest Mouse`_ and `Low`_.
The trio
(`Daniel`_, `Sondra`_, and `Eric`_)
have been playing together over fifteen years,
across a wide range of projects.
In the summer of 2015 they
released Teacup Gorilla's debut EP,
`The Holes They Leave`_,
along with the multimedia novel
`Riding SideSaddle*`_.


Since forming,
Teacup Gorilla has enjoyed playing
some of Denver's top venues — `Hi Dive`_,
`Syntax Physic Opera`_, `Larimer Lounge`_,
and the `Underground Music Showcase`_ —
collaborating with everyone from
`Jen Korte`_ and `Bad Luck City`_,
to `Buntport Theater`_, `Bouldering Poets`_,
and the `Clyfford Still Museum`_.
