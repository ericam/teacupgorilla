Adjectives
==========

**Teacup Gorilla** are a petite & deadly ground-dwelling band
that inhabits the china shops of Denver
with angular riffs,
twisted stories,
and obtuse stomping.

.. BAND
.. ----

`Daniel`_, `Eric`_, and `Sondra`_ have been
playing/fighting together over ten years,
and across a wide range of media,
before forming their own band in 2010.


.. BUSINESS
.. --------

Since then Teacup Gorilla has performed at
book releases and bars,
poetry readings, and hard-core house shows —
composed live theatre soundtracks,
founded the `The Bakery`_ arts warehouse,
and infiltrated great local venues
like Larimer Lounge, and Pikes Peak Brewing Co, and Lion's Lair.


.. MUSIC
.. -----

With a dark indie sound,
post-rock tendencies,
and a strong literary bent — 
Teacup Gorilla has been
compared to Rabbit is a Sphere,
Velvet Underground,
Everything Absent or Distorted (a love story),
and Low.
They are descended from the bonobo,
`Tom Waits`_, `Modest Mouse`_, `Mogwai`_, `Bad Luck City`_,
`Songs: Ohia`_, `Godspeed You! Black Emperor`_,
and `Fugazi`_ (to name an odd few).

They may be fine artists in the parlor,
but they're nasty in the garage.
