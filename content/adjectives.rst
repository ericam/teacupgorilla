The Band
--------

The smallest extant genus of primate musicians by size,
**Teacup Gorilla** are petite & deadly ground-dwelling apes
that inhabit the china shops of Denver
with angular riffs,
obtuse stomping,
street-level poetry,
and yelling at the audience.

What started with small-town math-punk in crowded basements
has grown into a long-term collaboration between three experienced artists
(`Daniel`_, `Eric`_, `Sondra`_)
and four or five artistic genres.
The three have played/fought for over ten years,
in bands like
Elephants for Sale, Dirt Circle Dogs, Iron City, and Raven Jane,

Since forming in 2010,
Teacup Gorilla have performed at poetry readings & hard-core house shows,
composed live theatre soundtracks,
and founded the `The Bakery`_ arts warehouse.
They are the next closest living relatives to humans after the bonobo,
`Tom Waits`_, `Modest Mouse`_, `Mogwai`_, `Bad Luck City`_,
`The Widow’s Bane`_, `Songs: Ohia`_, `Godspeed You! Black Emperor`_,
`Fugazi`_, and `Low`_ (to name an odd few).

They may be fine artists in the parlor,
but they're nasty in the garage.
