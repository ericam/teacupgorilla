Adjectives
==========

**Teacup Gorilla** are petite & deadly ground-dwelling apes
that inhabit the china shops of Denver
with angular riffs,
twisted stories,
and obtuse stomping.

.. BAND
.. ----

`Daniel`_, `Eric`_, and `Sondra`_ have been
playing/fighting together since 2001
in a mix of bands, theatres, and web design companies —
finally forming their own band in 2010.


.. BUSINESS
.. --------

Since then Teacup Gorilla has performed at
poetry readings, book releases,
& hard-core house shows,
composed live theatre soundtracks,
and founded the `The Bakery`_ arts warehouse —
while playing regularly around great local venues
like Larimer Lounge, and Pikes Peak Brewing Co, and Lion's Lair.


.. MUSIC
.. -----

With a dark indie sound,
post-rock tendencies,
and a strong literary bent — 
Teacup Gorilla has been
compared to Velvet Underground,
Everything Absent or Distorted (a love story),
Rabbit is a Sphere, and more.
They are also clearly decended from the bonobo,
`Tom Waits`_, `Modest Mouse`_, `Mogwai`_, `Bad Luck City`_,
`Songs: Ohia`_, `Godspeed You! Black Emperor`_,
`Fugazi`_, and `Low`_ (to name an odd few).

They may be fine artists in the parlor,
but they're nasty in the garage.
