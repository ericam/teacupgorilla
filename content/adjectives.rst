**Teacup Gorilla** inhabits the venues of Denver, CO
with dark indie-rock soundscapes and evocative poetry —
often compared to early `Modest Mouse`_,
`Low`_, or the Velvet Underground.
In the summer of 2015 they
released a debut EP
(`The Holes They Leave`_)
along with the multimedia novel
`Riding SideSaddle*`_.
In 2016,
they collaborated with `Buntport Theater`_,
adapting the novel for the stage,
and underscoring it live
to `rave reviews`_.
Now they're working with `Pandemic Collective`_
to underscore two new plays at `The Bakery`_.

Teacup Gorilla has enjoyed performing at
some of Denver's top venues —
`Hi Dive`_,
`Syntax Physic Opera`_,

`Globe Hall`_
and the `Underground Music Showcase`_ —
with bands like
`Bad Luck City`_,
`FaceMan`_,
`Muscle Beach`_,
`Altas`_,
and `Open to the Hound`_.
They also love collaborating
across media —
with
theaters,
video arists,
writers,
dancers,
and even the `Clyfford Still Museum`_.
