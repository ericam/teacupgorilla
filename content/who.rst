Bio
===

**Teacup Gorilla** is a mashup of music, performance, and poetry â€” inspired by artist such as Tom Waits, Mogwai, Bad Luck City, The Widow's Bane, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Low. They bring post-rock to poetry readings, and perform novels in crowded bars, without ever seeming out-of-place.

What started with math-punk in crowded small-town basements has grown into a long-term collaboration between three experienced multimedia artist. `Daniel Eisenstat`_ is a writer, composer, engineer, and multi-instrumentalist; `Sondra Eby`_ is a writer, visual artist, marketing consultant, and drummer; and `Eric Meyer`_ is a writer, web developer, digital artist, and bass player, with a background in ensemble theatre.

The three have played/fought together for over ten years, in bands such as Elephants for Sale, Dirt Circle Dogs (Onion AV Club B+ for *Kingdom Come*), Iron City, and Raven Jane (regular headliners at The Walnut Room, Meadowlark, and elsewhere). Recently they've been developing a new sound, creating live theatre soundscapes, and performing at readings and garage shows.
