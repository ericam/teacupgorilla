Bio
---

**Teacup Gorilla** is a petite & deadly band of angular riffs,
obtuse stomping, street-level poetry, and yelling at the audience.
The smallest extant genus of primate bands by size,
Teacup Gorilla are ground-dwelling apes
that inhabit the china shops of Denver, CO.

What started with small-town math-punk in crowded basements
has grown into a long-term collaboration between three experienced artists
(`Daniel`_, `Eric`_, `Sondra`_)
and four or five artistic genres.
They are the next closest living relatives to humans after the bonobo,
Tom Waits, Modest Mouse, Mogwai, Bad Luck City,
The Widow’s Bane, Songs: Ohia, Godspeed You! Black Emperor,
Fugazi, and Low.

The three have played/fought for over ten years,
in bands such as Elephants for Sale,
Dirt Circle Dogs, Iron City, and Raven Jane.
They've performed at poetry readings and hard-core house shows,
composed live theatre soundtracks, and started their own warehouse venue.

They may be fine artists in the parlor,
but they're nasty in the garage.
