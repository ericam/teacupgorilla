UMS Day 2
=========

I'm overwhelmed by all the music!
At this point I wander half-aimless,
in and out of venues —
quick to judge,
but more often inspired.
Glad to discover that most of my favorites are local,
and I can stalk them like a groupie
until the next UMS arrives again.

I've always loved `Accordion Crimes`_,
and they pulled through again last night —
full of dynamic surprise.
`Mako1972`_ has a similar post-punk thing going,
which I always enjoy.
`Raven Jane`_ and `The Truth & Spectacle`_ were excellent
(from our unbiased opinion of Daniel in a hat).
I've followed `Ian Cooke`_ for a while,
and was glad to see him returning to a simpler,
cello-driven sound.
Only caught the tail-end of `StaG`_,
but they earned another listen.
`Saturn Cowboys`_ was a raucus fun time,
and `Dragondeer`_ got the whole room (including us) excited
like no effect-heavy lead mandolin has ever done before.

This was a wonderful night of live/local music,
but my favorite discovery was the intricate shoegazing
soundscapes of `Dave Devine Relay`_.

Hey guys, want to share a bill sometime?
